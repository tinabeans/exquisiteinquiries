<strong>Exquisite Inquiries</strong> aims to document and understand the field of Design Research as it is being practiced today. My hope is to compile, over time, a collection of viewpoints, methodologies, and artifacts that comprise a helpful resource for students, budding practitioners, and others who want to learn more about this evolving practice.

### Project goals

At the outset, I defined these goals to guide development of this project:

1. To define what design research is and how it differs from other kinds of reearch
2. To identify the contexts and environments in which it is practiced
3. To collect the origin stories and perspectives of a diverse cross-section of practitioners
4. To catalog tools and methodologies of the trade
5. To trace the history of design research
6. To anticipate its future—where is the discipline headed? What are its biggest challenges?
7. To help those who are new to it gain understanding and traction

### What's in a name?

Merriam-Webster gives the following sub-definition of the word "exquisite" (emphasis is mine):

> 1a. marked by nice discrimination, <em>deep sensitivity</em>, or <em>subtle understanding</em>

It seems that, in an intuition-guided practice aimed at observing and interpreting complex human behaviors, one must embody these qualities in order to be successful. Thus the phrase "exquisite inquiry" popped into my mind one morning as an evocative yet apt descriptor for the primary act of design research.

### Who is behind this project?

My name is <a href="http://tinabeans.com" target="_blank">Tina Ye</a>. I'm a designer in New York City who has worked on digital products large and small, both independently and embedded in teams. Throughout the years, I have developed a growing curiosity and love for design research. These days, I'm working on developing design research into my main area of focus—which formed the original inspiration for this endeavor!
