Are you or do you know of a dedicated practitioner in the field of design research? If so, I'd like to meet them!

The practitioner interview is a one-hour conversation conducted over phone, in person, or over email to answer questions in the following three areas:

1. Personal story: how did life bring you to Design Research?

2. Shape of their practice: what context do you work within? What tools and methods do you prefer?

3. Perspective on the discipline as a whole: where do you see design research headed in a few years? What are its biggest problems and challenges?

The results of these interviews will be shared here, on ExquisiteInquiri.es, and on Medium.com.

If you would like to nominate yourself or someone else, please fill out this Google Form.

Since design research is such a growing field, you do not have to be a seasoned practitioner or thought leader to participate. Dedication to the craft and personal insight will give us plenty to talk about!
